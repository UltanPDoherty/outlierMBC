\description{
The distance of each observation to its \eqn{k^{th}}{k^th} nearest neighbour
is computed. We assume that the largest \code{max_out} kNN distances correspond to
potential outliers. We select the next largest kNN distance, outside of the
top \code{max_out}, as a benchmark value. We multiply this benchmark kNN distance
by \code{multiplier} to get the minimum threshold for our gross outliers. In other
words, a gross outlier must have a kNN distance at least \code{multiplier} times
greater than all of the observations which we do not consider to be potential
outliers.
