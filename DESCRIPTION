Description: This package contains functions designed to perform sequential 
    outlier identification and removal while fitting Gaussian mixture models or 
    linear cluster-weighted models. We seek to minimise the dissimilarity
    between the theoretical and observed distributions of the scaled squared
    sample Mahalanobis distances.
